    <H1>Help generating star fields</H1>
    <p>Welcome to the starfield generator by Martin Stellinga. This tool can help you generate and save images of star
        fields.</p>

    <p>The user interface consists of two sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The top section containing the settings.</li>
        <li>The bottom section containing the generated image.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the top section, you can create the various layers that will make up the star field you want to generated.
        There are two types of layers: <strong>star</strong> layers and <strong>nebula</strong> layers. Before going
        into the settings for
        each of these, it is important to understand how to create such layers.</p>

    <h2>Creating, deleting and generating layers</h2>
    <p>When you first open the application, three example layers will be present. They are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C',
        respectively.</p>
    <p>To create the actual image, the settings have to be generated into an actual star fields. That can be done using
        the
        <strong>generate</strong> button to the right for each individual layer, or you can generate all of them using
        the <strong>render all</strong>
        button at the bottom of the settings section.</p>
    <p>Note that the 'generate' buttons always regenerate their layer, while the 'render all' only generates layers if
        required because of setting changes.</p>
    <p>Next to the 'generate' buttons are 'X' (<strong>delete</strong>) buttons, which can be used to remove a layer.
    </p>
    <p>To add a layer, use the <strong>add</strong> button in the lower section of the screen. This puts the image
        section into 'add mode'
        where you can click on the image to add a new layer with the first coordinate at the place you click. Click
        <strong>done</strong> to return to your image.</p>
    <h3>Coordinates</h3>
    <p>As noted above, all layers have one or more coordinates that determine where they randomly generate stars or
        nebulae.
        You can manipulate these coordinates in move mode.</p>
    <p>If you click on <strong>Move</strong> in the lower section, you will go to 'move mode'. In that mode you can move
        coordinates of layers around.
        All coordinates are marked with the letter of the section, followed by the point index.
        Click <strong>done</strong> to return to your image.</p>
    <p>You can also edit the coordinates in the settings section. If you click the 'V' button of a layer, the settings
        will expand
        and reveal a numbered list of coordinates. For each of these coordinates you can edit the X and Y values.
        Note that Y goes from top to bottom, meaning y = 0 is at the <em>top</em> of the image. X goes from left to
        right.</p>
    <p>To hide the coordinates again, click the '^' button.</p>

    <h2>Star Layers</h2>
    <p>A star layer generates a (definable) number of stars in random places of the image. You can adjust the following
        settings
        for those generated stars:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Layer type:</strong>If you change this to 'Nebula', the layer changes to a nebula layer (see below).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Star type:</strong> This can be 'Circle', 'Rect', or 'Path'.
            A Circle layer has a single coordinate and generates stars in a circle around that coordinate.
            A Rect layer has two coordinate and generates stars in a rectangle with the left-top corner and bottom-right
            corner at these two coordinates.
            A Path layer has as many coordinates as you want. It generates stars in a radius around the path formed by
            the coordinates of this layer.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gen. radius:</strong>These two values determine the radius for randomly generating stars. The
            randomizer favors the first radius over the last radius.
            Setting the first value lower than the second will cluster stars in the inner radius. If you set them to
            equal values, the stars will be more evenly distributed
            in the circle/path.
        </li>
        <li><strong>#</strong>The number of stars to randomly generate in this layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Brightness:</strong>Determine the brightness of the generated stars. The brightness of individual
            stars is distributed evenly,
            however you can use the slider to change the brightness value for all generated stars in the layer.<br/>
            If you already generated this layer, when you release the slider, the image is automatically updated with
            the new brightness.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bloom:</strong>Determine how much blooming happens to the stars in this layer. A lower value will
            result in pinprick stars,
            where a high value will result in the star blooming out.<br/>
            If you already generated this layer, when you release the slider, the image is automatically updated with
            the new brightness.
        </li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nebula Layers</h2>
    <p>A nebula layer generates a (definable) number of nebulae in random places of the image. You can adjust the
        following settings
        for those generated nebulae:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Layer type:</strong>If you change this to 'Stars', the layer changes to a star layer (see above).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Nebula type:</strong> This can be 'Circle' or 'Path'.
            A Circle layer has a single coordinate and generates nebulae in a circle around that coordinate.
            A Path layer has as many coordinates as you want. It generates nebulae in a radius around the path formed by
            the coordinates of this layer.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gen. radius:</strong>These two values determine the radius for randomly generating nebulae. The
            randomizer favors the first radius over the last radius.
            Setting the first value lower than the second will cluster nebulae in the inner radius. If you set them to
            equal values, the nebulae will be more evenly distributed
            in the circle/path.
        </li>
        <li><strong># seeds:</strong>The number of nebulae to randomly generate in this layer.
            Note that each nebulae starts with a randomly generated seed (which the following settings affect) which is
            then expanded using a fractal algorithm.<br/>
            'Fractal' means the initial seed (a circle) is subdivided a number of times to create a random cloud.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Seed radius:</strong>The radius of the intial nebula seeds. The size of the seeds is randomly chosen
            between these two values.
        </li>
        <li><strong># fractals:</strong>The number of times to subdivide the initial nebula seed.</li>
        <li><strong>Shrink/step:</strong>The amount to reduce the radius by at each subdivision.
            Values above 0.5 will result in a cloud-like nebula, while values below 0.5 will result in isolated puffs.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Divisions/step:</strong>How many new circles to generated at each subdivision step.
            The circles are evenly created with the center along the rim of their parent.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Angle shift/step:</strong>When subdividing the nebula, the children are evenly distributed along the
            rim of their parents,
            but the initial angle will be shifted by the value (in radians) in this setting.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hue:</strong>The color of this nebula.<br/>
            If you already generated this layer, when you release the slider, the image is automatically updated with
            the new hue.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fade:</strong>For each of the subdivided circles of the nebula, the fade determine if they should
            fade at the center (inner) or outside (outside).<br/>
            If you already generated this layer, when you release the slider, the image is automatically updated with
            the new brightness.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Brightness:</strong>Determine the brightness of the generated nebulae. Note that nebulae are lighted
            partially by the stars and partially by this value.<br/>
            If you already generated this layer, when you release the slider, the image is automatically updated with
            the new brightness.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Smooth:</strong>Determine how much smoothing happens to the nebula in this layer. Higher settings
            will reduce contrasting edges.<br/>
            If you already generated this layer, when you release the slider, the image is automatically updated with
            the new brightness.
        </li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>General settings</h2>
    <p>Below the layers are some general settings that affect the rendering:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gas fog effect:</strong>This slider effects how the stars and nebulae interact. Higher values will
            cause more of a blooming effect for stars in nebulae.<br/>
            When you release the slider, the image is automatically updated with the new brightness for all layers that
            were already generated.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Image size:</strong> Which, unsurprisingly, changes the size of the image to generate.
        </li>
    </ul>
